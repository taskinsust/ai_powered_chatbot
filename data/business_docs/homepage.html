The Directorate of National Consumers Rights Protection (DNCRP) fined Tk4.5 lakh to the Uttara outlet of Aarong and closed it for a day for selling the same products at double price within a gap of five days. Following on a client's complaint that Aarong was selling a panjabi after nearly doubling its price, DNCRP officials visited the chain's flagship store on Jashimuddin Avenue at Uttara on 31 May 2019 and fined them after finding the allegation to be true. Monjur Mohammad Shahriar, deputy director of Directorate of National Consumers Rights Protection (DNCRP) led the drive but he was transferred later.[2]
